The goal is to design a heat exchanger that reduces the temperature of 
acetic acid water solution from 100 degree celsius to 50 degree celsius
by using a cooling water feed with 25 degree celsius. 

To run this code install required libraries by using pip install -r requirements.txt
Creating a virtual environment is highly recommended
